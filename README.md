===========

The following files were given to start this lab.  These files were altered to meet the requirements of the lab.

#**Design**

##ALU Modifications 

When given the ALU shell, the only part that was finished was the importing of the needed libraries, the specifications of the inputs/outputs, and the outline for where processes and conditional statements should go. 
This original file can be seen here:

This is a screenshot of the ALU simulation.  It words correctly!! Now the ALU can be used to make the data path.
